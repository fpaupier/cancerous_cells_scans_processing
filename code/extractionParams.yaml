# This is an example of a parameters file
# It is written according to the YAML-convention (www.yaml.org) and is checked by the code for consistency.
# Three types of parameters are possible and reflected in the structure of the document:
#
# Parameter category:
#   Setting Name: <value>
#
# The three parameter categories are:
# - setting: Setting to use for pre-processing and class specific settings. if no <value> is specified, the value for
#   this setting is set to None.
# - featureClass: Feature class to enable, <value> is list of strings representing enabled features. If no <value> is
#   specified or <value> is an empty list ('[]'), all features for this class are enabled.
# - imageType: image types to calculate features on. <value> is custom kwarg settings (dictionary). if <value> is an
#   empty dictionary ('{}'), no custom settings are added for this input image.
#
# Some parameters have a limited list of possible values. Where this is the case, possible values are listed in the
# package documentation

# Settings to use, possible settings are listed in the documentation (section "Customizing the extraction").

#### Warning missing features :
# - TLG (Total Lesion Glycolysis)  - the mean of voxels within ROI * volume
# - Nb Voxels
# - ZP (zone percentage) - not exactly same definition as Thomas

setting:
  binWidth: 25 # FIXME binwidth value to check
  label: 1
  interpolator: 'sitkBSpline' # This is an enumerated value, here None is not allowed
  resampledPixelSpacing: # This disables re-sampling, as it is interpreted as None, to enable it, specify spacing in x, y, z as [x, y , z]
  weightingNorm: # If no value is specified, it is interpreted as None


imageType:
  Original: {} # for dictionaries / mappings, None values are not allowed, '{}' is interpreted as an empty dictionary
